# SacrumDS: A Novel Dataset for 3D Sacrum Reconstruction from Computed Tomography Scans

### Introduction to SacrumDS
**We introduce SacrumDS**, a comprehensive three-dimensional sacral dataset aimed at sacral injury research in the elderly (>50 years old). The dataset constitutes 864 genuine clinical cases, with each one containing an average of 427,000 sacral feature points, amassing a total of 364.9M data points. It categorizes data by the patient's age group (i.e., 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, >90 years old), biological sex (i.e., male, female), and disease type (i.e., femoral neck, sacral, pubic, femoral intertrochanteric fractures, normal pelvis, femoral head fracture, acetabular fracture, iliac fractures), making it the most extensive three-dimensional sacral dataset to date. SacrumDS supports research on sacral-related diseases, advocates for the standardization of sacroiliac screw pathway planning, aids in establishing standardized sacral models, and demystifies the mechanisms of sacral bone density evolution in the elderly.
